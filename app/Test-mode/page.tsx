                The way mental function changes is largely determined by three factorsâ€”mental lifestyle,
                the impact of chronic disease, and flexibility of the mind.

                Recent research has shown that memory and cognitive performance can be improved at
                any age. Studies carried out at the University of California at Irvine have shown that
                mental abilities tend to be at their sharpest at around 9 am, and then decline as the day
                goes on. However, older people tend to reverse this pattern, with their performance
                improving throughout the day.
